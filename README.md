# Registrar

This project is a webpage designed to help new students enroll in our club. As a technical member of the club, I developed this webpage to provide an easy and efficient way for prospective members to register and become part of the club community.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the webpage, including the registration form and other necessary sections.
CSS: Applied to style the webpage and give it a clean, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing look. The design is modern and responsive to provide a seamless experience across different devices.
JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the webpage. This includes form validation to ensure the data entered by the user is accurate before submission.
PHP: The backend of the webpage is built using PHP. It processes the registration form, handles data submissions, and connects to a database to store new student entries securely.

Features:
Registration Form: The webpage includes a registration form that captures important details about the new member, such as:

Name:
Registration Number:
Age:
Interested Field (Area of Interest within the club):
Time and Date of Registration:
Engineering Department (CSE, ECE, Mechanical):


User-Friendly Interface: The page has a simple, clear, and organized layout to make it easy for new students to quickly find and fill out the form.

Form Validation: JavaScript is used for form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly and that data is entered in the proper format before submission.

Backend Processing: The PHP script processes the submitted form data and saves it to the club's database for record-keeping and further processing. It ensures that no duplicate entries are made and that the data is securely stored.
